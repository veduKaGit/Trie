Below is a photo for a Trie made for a given dictionary.

Points to note:
1. An empty trie is represented as => a (root node) where (all 26 children are NULL) AND (isEndOfWord == false)
2. Every node has an (array of children) and a (boolean variable isEndOfWord)
3. It is NOT necessary that ONLY last node has isEndOfWord == true. (see the figure below)
